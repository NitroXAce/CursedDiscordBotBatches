# Introduction
Here is some of the most **cursed Javascript** Discord files as "flavors"!  Over the years I have literally **handicapped** myself on making discord bots using a specific aspect of javascript.  Some of which renders **var**, **let**, and **const** useless for assignments.  All of these "flavors" do the exact same thing, but written so differently!  With years of "experience", I have crafted some of the most "beautiful" written flavors, where consistency is king, and the points dont matter!

## Lets lay some "groundwork"
While avoiding typical means of assigning, I have to approach at what I am being given.  These questions comes to mind:
 - "How do I store a value?"
 - "How do I manipulate what I store?"
In each of these *wonderfully* **cursed** flavors, I have two "parameters" for this exercise.  This shall serve how I "war gamed" JavaScript.  If I view things in those two basic rules, anything is game!  Whats more funny? (for entertainment value only in this document!) Why not add a "hypothetical" boss to each of these **flavors**

## SFW - for those who are insensitive to abstraction
Here is a "normal" javascript for those silly critics who always want *"clean,"* and *"professional"* code.  For the beginners who need a reference to start with.  We all have beginnings to start at, right?  And this little lovely **quoteNormal.js** is where it all begins!  Prepare your butts you React-Andies, because this little lovely world tour of cursed programming, will leave you with a brain hemmorhage. >:3
 - **Hypothetical Boss:**  Someone who is *allergic* to **anything** abstract, someone who doesn't want to have their world absolutely shoved in!
 - **Assignments:** normal means
 - **Manipulate:** normal means

## CLASS ONLY (works in full)
In **classOnly.js**, the file is basically a middle finger to my former employer who said that classes were the best damned thing ever as it works best with a database platform.  While I hated classes to a T, I left in peaceful terms.  Thus I returned and made... that! "What happens if I neutered myself by making classes everywhere?" Meaning:
 - no methods, must class!
 - no function callbacks, must class instead?!

So how did I accomplish this *beautiful* Javascript challenge?
 - **Hypothetical Boss:** This boss LOVES classes so much he wants you to marry it!  Not only so!  But that ANY methods, and callbacks YOU write SHOULD be classes.  He also hates how Objects are written because it reminds him of his COLON cancer. So the only way **around** Objects, is to make a self invoked class! (as if your own crap can't be kicked in any further!).  He is definitely a-okay on chaining new keywords in consequence.
 - **Assignments:** Class Fields,  This.Assignments, and objects as IICE (IIFE's version but **classy**)
 - **Manipulate:** Class as callbacks, methods, and self invoked classes as returned objects

## Expression Heavy Functional Bot
In **funcExpress.js**, this is what happens when you're allergic to EVERY keyword and rely on logical operators and unique mending of objects to handle multi-conditions! Why make such an abomination?  What happens if your boss snorts about *"ImAgInE, CrEaTiNg An ApPlIcAtIoN wItHoUt DoInG NoRmAl PrOgRaMmInG?"*  And voila! Keywordless AND statementless flavored discord bot has been born!
 - **Hypothetical Boss:** This boss is **REALLY** flamboyant, very experessive!  So much so that statements, no longer appeases him anymore.  *"OnE StAtEmEnT i SHaLl I nEeD!"* - He said, probably.  So what does he suggest?  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING Statement wise, everything must be kept contained in expressions only!  Meaning no; var, let, const, if/else (except ternaries), switch/case (except using objects as an inefficient match condition), nor even for/while loops!  So what is left is... :,)
 - **Assignments:** Default Parameters inside of localized IIFEs
 - **Manipulate:** IIFEs and normal function stuff (and only **arrow** functions)

## CurryScript
An attempt at making "object-less" funcitonal programming using callbacks and currying, in **curryScript.js**, its almost exactly that, currying, some spicy indian stew all over your computer screen!  Just waiting for you to get indigestion!  Its similar in vain to **funcExpress.js** as it still retains the allergies of keywords.
 - **Hypothetical Boss:** So we met the boss thats expression based only, right?  Well, meet his replacement, some spicy dude who wants nothing but curry for every single meal he gets!  Still just as **flamobyant** as FuncExpress's Boss.  But Objects? Nah, lets just curry the hell out of everything instead, *pfft* who **needs** Objects, am I right? :'D
 - **Assignments:** Same as FuncExpress, but object assignment is curries
 - **Manipulate:** Same as FuncExpress

## GENERATOR HELL (a work in progress)
Something unique 95% of javascript developers haven't heard of yet is called "generators".  Generators are generally useful for pagination and "pausing" or "waiting" on instruction use cases.  Much like a Master chef telling the mixer to mix ingredients WHEN the Chef says so!  However... in this case? Its just an iteration nightmare!
 - **Hypothetical Boss:**
 - **Assignments:**
 - **Manipulate:**

## Lets target older devs! (a work in progress)
Want to make the cursed code more compatible to very older browsers, and make it precursor to the class introduction? Fear no more!  In **oldfunctionHell.js** thats exactly that!  Just pure... **unadulterated...** new Function() hell! 0 var, let, and consts are  being used here too, like **classOnly.js** but much, MUCH older!
 - **Hypothetical Boss:**
 - **Assignments:**
 - **Manipulate:**

## Prototype hell (a work in progress)
Much like the **oldFunctionHell.js**, I wanted to target prototype, as its weird to just yeet the prototype chain into the abyss, but instead, *"LeTs InCoRpOrAtE It InTo OuR CoDeBaSe"* and see how far we can get away just using prototype from what wee learned from **oldFunctionHell.js** 
 - **Hypothetical Boss:**
 - **Assignments:**
 - **Manipulate:**

## Finally
What I often hear when sharing this "beautiful" knowledge from various users is:
 - "Who **hurt** you?!"
 - "**Why** are you **doing** this?!"
 - "What real world use case is this for?"

To which I reply "Good", and "Because it simply works!" because I am a curious Javascript developer, testing edge cases since I was younger, while I dont have ANY SINGLE EXPERIENCE IN TECH! I am however, just a paid factory laborer while fixing boats on the side.  I do this for fun first, and monetary value last.  My goal is to make people THINK about odd, out of the box thinking and how to impliment these cool ideas!  Even then, be consistent in writing styles so no one gets confused!  I am Gareth (a vtuber "Ace Tributon"), and I am glad to have blessed your eyeballs today!  Take your time to have a bit of therapy, some milk, and touch some grass!  Because I wont stop at just javascript...  Enjoy! >:3
